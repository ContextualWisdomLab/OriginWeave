//! Direct-only policy-bound TCP connection authority for OriginWeave.
//!
//! The crate consumes validated connection plans, opens exact socket addresses
//! without hostname resolution or proxy inheritance, verifies operating-system
//! peers before exposing transport I/O, and emits credential-free evidence.
//! It also bridges a session-correlated WebDriver BiDi loopback target from
//! `originweave-core` into one bounded exact TCP connection without granting
//! browser, WebSocket, TLS, policy, or Agent authority.
