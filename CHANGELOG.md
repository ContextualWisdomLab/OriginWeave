## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Rust workspace for independently reusable core, policy, destination, resource, and evidence modules.
- Canonical HTTPS and loopback-origin boundary with case-normalized schemes and hosts, default-port normalization, IPv4/IPv6 handling, browser-special numeric-host rejection, and explicit malformed-input errors.
- Typed browser actions, capabilities, risk classes, execution modes, robots decisions, secret-delivery contracts, immutable canonical action-intent digests, and intent-bound approval scopes.
- Deterministic fail-closed policy evaluation for untrusted instructions, origin grants, crawler restrictions, execution-mode and purpose consistency, approvals, and brokered secrets.
- Fail-closed resolved-destination policy with IPv4/IPv6 special-purpose and reviewed cloud-platform endpoint classification, IPv4-mapped canonicalization, explicit class grants, non-empty origin-bound DNS snapshots capped at 256 resolver addresses, concrete connection pinning, DNS-set expansion detection, and per-hop redirect reauthorization.
- Credential-free connection and redirect evidence containing canonical addresses, destination classes, target digests, hop numbers, and approved-address counts.
- Cumulative interactive-first RAM, VRAM, batch, local-model, admission, pause, and compositor-pressure mitigation plans, including active-consumer reduction at exact hard limits.
- Universally value-redacted network evidence with explicit path, metadata, and provenance bounds; ambiguous path rejection; validated source URLs; lowercase SHA-256 identifiers; and verification state.
- Rust 1.97.1 build contract, strict Clippy and rustdoc gates, and exact production function, line, region, and branch coverage enforcement.
- Hourly bounded OpenCode product-development workflow using `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY`, an unprivileged disposable workspace, loopback-only model broker, independently verified patches, and publication through a dedicated `OPENCODE_PR_TOKEN` that cannot review or merge.
- Architecture, agent, security, contribution, research, database naming, roadmap, and quality-gate documentation.

### Changed

- Separated logical origin authority from resolved network destination authority; an origin grant no longer implies permission to connect to every resolver result.
- Replaced single resource-pressure directives with a cumulative mitigation plan so simultaneous RAM, VRAM, frame, model, and admission pressure cannot discard required actions.
- Changed generic network capture from finite deny-lists or safe-name allow-lists to unconditional value redaction. Typed metadata values and bodies now require a separate schema-specific capture contract.
- Updated the first Chromium slice to distinguish the implemented pure destination kernel from the remaining DNS/socket, proxy/PAC, response-budget, MIME, download, and browser-adapter work required before safe navigation can be claimed.
- Separated hourly product PR publication authority from the organization review and merge system, and added live default-branch and release-blocker rechecks immediately before publication.
- Moved autonomous-agent Cargo targets and Python bytecode caches outside the proposed source tree and prefetched locked Cargo dependencies for offline verification.
- Updated research doctoring to distinguish the April 2026 Fugu beta from the June 2026 release and to treat vendor benchmark claims as first-party evidence rather than independent validation.

### Security

- Raw page content cannot become a trusted instruction.
- Raw secrets are rejected and secret-capable actions require an opaque broker handle.
- Crawler mode is read-only, must pair with the public-crawl purpose, and fails closed without an applicable robots-policy decision.
- State-changing actions are same-origin by default.
- R3 and R4 approvals are bound to the exact action, target origin, and immutable digest of the complete canonical action intent; R5 legal consent is non-delegable.
- Shortened, integer, hexadecimal, and legacy octal-looking IPv4 host spellings are rejected so the policy origin cannot diverge from Chromium host interpretation.
- IPv4-mapped IPv6 is canonicalized before destination classification and pin comparison so mapped private or loopback addresses cannot bypass IPv4 policy.
- The default destination policy permits only public addresses and denies unspecified, loopback, private, shared, link-local, metadata, documentation, benchmarking, multicast, broadcast, transition, and protocol-reserved destinations.
- Azure platform IP `168.63.129.16` and Amazon EKS Pod Identity endpoints `169.254.170.23` and `fd00:ec2::23` are classified as metadata or platform services before broader public, link-local, or unique-local rules.
- Resolver answers are rejected when empty or larger than 256 addresses, preventing an unbounded resolver response from entering policy state.
- `localhost` may approve only loopback addresses, while literal IPv4 and IPv6 origins may approve only the exact canonical address encoded in the origin.
- Resolver answers must remain a non-empty subset of the origin-bound approved address set; any newly introduced address fails closed as a possible DNS-rebinding event.
- Every redirect rechecks target-origin authority, target-bound resolution, HTTPS downgrade, complete-target cycle state, and hop capacity before policy state changes.
- Every generic network header and query value is redacted before evidence leaves the trusted boundary, including conventionally benign field names containing attacker-controlled bytes.
- Evidence capture enforces count and byte bounds and rejects credential-bearing source URLs, query strings, fragments, controls, whitespace, malformed percent escapes, encoded separators, dot segments, and backslash paths.
- Hard RAM and VRAM pressure pauses the active agent and rejects new admission; hard VRAM pressure also offloads a resident local model.
- The hourly product agent has no Git metadata or repository authority. A separate post-verification publisher opens one PR and cannot approve or merge it.
- The unprivileged OpenCode user is restricted to loopback egress during model execution, preventing runner-wide allow-listed endpoints from becoming direct source-exfiltration channels.
